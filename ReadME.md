# FILE DIRECTORIES AND FILE NAMES

Please make sure that all image files are located in the ../src/assets directory. All vector graphics will be stored in the /assets/SVG directory.

When naming files you are adding to the project, please give them semantic names so they are easy to find and reference while working. All file names should be all lower case with dashes between words (i.e. dixie-header-img).
